            <h1>safari</h1>
            <p>At Tathastu, we believe that wildlife is a vital component of our shared existence and we are deeply
                committed to protecting the environment for future generations to cherish. Our safaris offer a unique
                opportunity to experience the raw beauty of the wilderness up close, immersing you in the sights, sounds
                and serenity of the forest. It's not just about witnessing wildlife— it's about forging a profound
                connection with nature that inspires respect and a sense of responsibility towards our planet.</p>

                <h3>ANIMESH MANNA</h3>
                <p>I'm Animesh Manna, from Kolkata, the 'City of Joy.' Fascinated with small creatures since childhood,
                    I stepped away from formal education after graduating in Geography to observe nature firsthand. I
                    enjoyed studying butterflies and dragonflies, documenting their life cycles. I began my career as a
                    naturalist in the Sundarbans, later moving to Pench. I've explored the Satpura Tiger Reserve as
                    well. I also love making short nature videos, cooking, and reading ghost stories. Now, as Chief
                    Naturalist at Tathastu, I'm eager to grow with the expansion of our properties across M.P. and
                    Maharashtra.</p>

            <h3>RATAN LAL Tanan</h3>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ratan, though most people know me as Ratanji. Originally from Rajasthan, I’ve been in Pench since
                2000. Even though I haven’t received any formal training as a naturalist, I’ve gained a deep
                understanding of the forest and its wildlife during my long stays in the jungle while working as a
                contractor for the forest department. My special connection with the locals, particularly the guides and
                gypsy drivers, allows me to gather insights into animal movements from previous days, giving me an
                advantage in planning safari drives.</p>

GHANSHYAM PRASAD
BHANAWARE</h3>
<p>Hello. I am Ghanshyam Prasad Bhanaware. I come from Kanha. I always had deep connection with nature from childhood. I did my schooling and spend my childhood in lap of Banjar River and its nearby villages. With over 13 years of work experience at Kanha national park, I gained deep working experience through serving in different departments of safari lodges like Front office, Lodge activity in charge, Operations, Naturalist etc. During my working in Kanha I started studying about birds and butterflies of the tiger reserve. I also love to document interesting animal behaviour with my camera. I always admire of local culture and rituals which makes me confident to travel with my guests and share best of my knowledge with them.</p>

            <h3>NARESH SINGH(GUDDA)</h3>
           <p>I, Naresh Singh, fondly known as Gudda, have been working as a naturalist for almost two decades. Being born and raised in Bandhavgarh, my connection with the landscape is deeply rooted. I honed my skills in tracking tigers and understanding their behavior during my time as a naturalist. It’s a cherished moment for me when guests refer to me as the "Mowgli of Bandhavgarh." My passion for wildlife has taken me beyond Bandhavgarh to different parts of India, where I’ve observed the country’s rich biodiversity. I was honored to receive a special mention award from Sanctuary Asia, India’s leading wildlife magazine. I firmly believe that to conserve India’s wildlife diversity, I must capture the attention of the general public by guiding them through the jungle and offering them a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

ISHAN SHAH</h3>
<p>i, I'm Ishan Shah, hailing from the busiest city in India, Mumbai. Despite being from Mumbai, I’ve always dreamed of working in nature, exploring the outdoors, and infusing plant knowledge into food while living an adventurous life. Becoming a naturalist was a dream come true, as it allows me to explore not only the flora but also the fauna of the world. It feels like opening my eyes to a new world. This role has also given me the chance to meet new people and discover my hidden hospitality skills, which even I wasn’t aware of. Sharing my passion for nature with guests is something I love, offering my perspective on how we can be a part of it by exploring its wonders, whether through safaris or simply taking a walk in the jungle. Happy exploring!</p>
